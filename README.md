# multi-agent-learning
Reinforcement Learning algorithm [MADDPG](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.02275.pdf) is used to train openai's [multi-agent particle environments](https://github.com/openai/multiagent-particle-envs).


#Acknowledgements
The code is based on [multi-agent-rl](https://github.com/rohan-sawhney/multi-agent-rl) and refactored to make it more undersatndable. Furthermore tensorflow was replaced by a pytorch implementation which is based on [DDPG](https://github.com/samlanka/DDPG-PyTorch).
